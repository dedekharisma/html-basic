# My Front End Journey: HTML Basic

Welcome to the first step in my <a href="https://github.com/dedekharisma/my-frontend-journey">front-end development journey</a>! This repository is dedicated to learning the fundamentals of **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**â€”the backbone of every webpage on the internet.

## What You'll Find Here

- **HTML**: The foundation of any web page. I'm exploring how to structure content, use semantic elements, and build the skeleton of a web page.
- **CSS**: Styling is where the magic happens! I'm learning how to bring life to my web pages with colors, layouts, responsiveness, and some basic animations.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity to my projects. This includes understanding the DOM, handling events, and making web pages dynamic and engaging.

## Repository Structure
- `README.md`: You're reading it! This file is here to explain what I'm doing and why.

## Why I'm Doing This

I've always been fascinated by the web and how it works. This repository is my way of taking the first steps towards becoming a proficient web developer. By documenting my journey here, I hope to track my progress and maybe even help others who are on a similar path.

Thanks for checking out my work, and happy coding!
